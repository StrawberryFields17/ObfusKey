# 🔐 ObfusKey

A hybrid **C# + Python** security tool that protects against keyloggers by:
- Intercepting physical keyboard input.
- Suppressing it from normal OS channels.
- Re-injecting the same keys through software (`SendInput`) to confuse spyware.
- Securely encrypting keystrokes and optionally logging them.
- Providing a GUI interface and Python control layer.

## 💡 Features

### 1. 🛡️ Secure Keyboard Hook
- Intercepts all key presses.
- Prevents propagation to OS through normal channels (making keyloggers blind).
- Re-injects keys using `SendInput`, simulating natural behavior.

### 2. 🔄 Named Pipe Control (Python → C#)
- Send `TOGGLE_JARBLE` command from Python to toggle protection.
- Fully decoupled control layer.

### 3. 🖥️ GUI Interface (C#)
- Simple Windows Form with a toggle button.
- Live display of obfuscation status (`ENABLED` / `DISABLED`).

### 4. 🔐 AES-Encrypted Logging
- Logs keystrokes securely to `encrypted_keystrokes.log`.
- Uses Python's `cryptography` module (Fernet/AES-256).
- Includes timestamp for each keystroke.

### 5. 📡 Live Logging (C# → Python)
- C# sends each re-injected keystroke to a Python pipe server.
- Pipe server writes them encrypted in real-time.
- Avoids local plaintext leaks.

## 🧪 How To Run

### 1. Build and Run C# Hook
- Open `CSharpHook.csproj` in Visual Studio.
- Set `MainForm.cs` as startup object.
- Build and run.

### 2. Start Python Logging Server
```bash
cd PythonController
python pipe_logger_server.py
```

### 3. Send Control Commands (Optional)
```bash
python pipe_client.py
# Sends "TOGGLE_JARBLE" to C# app
```

## 🛠️ Installer (optional)
You can package this using:
- **pyinstaller** for Python scripts → EXE
- **Inno Setup / NSIS** for bundling C# binary + Python layer into one installer

---

## 📊 GUI Decrypted Log Viewer (planned)
- Future integration to view and decrypt logs from the GUI.

---

## 🔍 Filtering and Detection (planned)
- Add keyword filters to ignore certain inputs (e.g., `CTRL`, `ALT`).
- Add keylogger detection logic in `monitor.py`.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes
- This tool does not defend against kernel-level keyloggers.
- Best used on trusted systems or VMs to reduce attack surface.

---

## ✅ Requirements

**C# Side**
- Windows
- .NET Framework or .NET 6+

**Python Side**
```bash
pip install cryptography pywin32 psutil
```
